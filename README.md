# Generisc
A microkernel Operating system written- and using only C code. The aim is to have maximum correctness in the code, and for the OS to be as reliable and minimal as possible. Everything possible should be in sandboxes/jails, with a "snapshotter" to fall back to last stable state. All of the parts in the OS will have generic names. We have no name for the OS yet, but it will be a generic one :)

# OS
Operating system using only open source software. All components written in C. Microkernel(seL4?). Cross-compatible with touchscreens and keyboards. AI integrated. Maybe glasses or lenses as hardware with microphone and speakers in them.

#Target platform
Sipeed Maix Amigo
