# Barrass-and-Dyrseth-OS
A microkernel Operating system written- and using only C code. The aim is to have maximum correctness in the code, and for the OS to be as reliable and minimal as possible. Everything possible should be in sandboxes/jails, with a "snapshotter" to fall back to last stable state. All of the parts in the OS will have generic names. The target platform is first the (RISC-V)SiFive HiFive1 Rev B. We have no name for the OS yet, but it will be a generic one :)
